# New Forms of Data

### Training Series

The <a href="https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/" target=_blank>UK Data Service</a> is pleased to release open learning materials from its training series: *New Forms of Data for Social Science Research*. Vast swathes of our social interactions and personal behaviours are conducted online and/or captured digitally. Our use of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram generates astounding amounts of data, much of which is available from these platforms if you have the right programming skills. Snapshots of our daily lives are routinely captured and aggreagted into large, rich administrative datasets. Websites can be scraped and marshalled into statistically-usable datasets, and documents aggregated into large corpora of text information that can be mined for interesting patterns (e.g., through sentiment analysis). Thus, computational methods for collecting, processing and analysing new forms of data are an increasingly important component of a social scientistâ€™s toolkit.

### Materials

We have provided sample code, webinar recordings and slides, reading lists, FAQs and more for each of the topics covered under the *New Forms of Data* training series:
