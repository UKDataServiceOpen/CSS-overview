# Interactive coding materials

The following are Jupyter notebooks containing a mix of Python code, narrative and output associated with each topic.

If you would like to run and/or edit the materials for your own purposes, click on the *Launch Binder* button associated with each notebook. This will launch the notebook in your browser without the need to install anything on your machine.
