# Interactive coding materials

We have developed a number of Jupyter notebooks containing a mix of Python code, narrative and output associated with each topic.

If you would like to run and/or edit the materials for your own purposes, click on the notebook below. This will launch the notebook in your browser without the need to install anything on your machine.

Alternatively, you can download the notebook files and run them on your own installation of `Jupyter Notebooks`: see our guidance on installing Python and Jupyter [here](LINK).
