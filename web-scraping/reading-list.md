# Reading List

The following are suggested books, papers, websites and other resources for developing your web-scraping and Python skills further.

### Web-scraping

Lau, S., Gonzalez, J., & Nolan, D. (n.d.). *Principles and Techniques of Data Science*. <a href="https://www.textbook.ds100.org" target=_blank>https://www.textbook.ds100.org</a>. <br>
Note: Chapter 7 covers web technologies but the book is an excellent introduction to quantitative data analysis in Python in general.

### Python
