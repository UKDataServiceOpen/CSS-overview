# Reading List

The following are suggested books, papers, websites and other resources for developing your web-scraping and Python skills further.

### Web-scraping

Lau, S., Gonzalez, J., & Nolan, D. (n.d.). *Principles and Techniques of Data Science*. <a href="https://www.textbook.ds100.org" target=_blank>https://www.textbook.ds100.org</a>. <br>
Note: Chapter 7 covers web technologies but the book is an excellent introduction to quantitative data analysis in Python in general.

### Python

Brooker, P. (2020). *Programming with Python for Social Scientists*. London: SAGE Publications Ltd. <br>
Note: A readable and broad introduction to computational methods for social science research; mixes theoretical and practical content well.

VanderPlas, J. (2016). *Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data*. <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/" target=_blank>https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/</a> <br>
Note: An in-depth treatment of core data science tasks in Python - calculations, data frames, visualisation and machine learning.
