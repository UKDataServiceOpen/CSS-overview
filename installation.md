# Installing Python
These instructions guide you through the process of installing Python and other packages (e.g., Jupyter Notebook) on your machine. There are also instructions for creating a computing environment that enables you to run the web-scraping code associated with the *Web-scraping for Social Science Research* training series.

### Step 1 - Install Python

The easiest means of installing Python is to download the free Anaconda distribution of the programming language. Follow the instructions provided:
* <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#windows" target=_blank>Windows download</a>
* <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#linux" target=_blank>Linux download</a>
* <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#macos" target=_blank>Mac download</a>

### Step 2 - Create folder to store code and data

The next step is to create a folder on your machine for storing the web-scraping code and other necessary materials. Open your command line interface (CLI) and type the following (ignore lines beginning with #):
```
# Windows

mkdir web-scraping
cd web-scraping
```

This creates a new folder on your machine for storing the files. Now place the following files in this folder:
* aus-charity-data-download.py
* requirements.txt
